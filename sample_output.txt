### Diseases Discussed in the Corpus

The primary focus of the corpus is on **cystic fibrosis (CF)**, a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. The corpus extensively covers various genetic mutations associated with CF, such as F508del, W1282X, L227R, and N1303K, among others [Data: Reports (88, 31, 22, 95, 124, +more)]. These mutations are central to the discussion of disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies.

Beyond CF, the corpus also touches upon **cancer**, specifically modeling oncogenic mutations like TP53 in human organoids, which supports cancer research and personalized medicine approaches [Data: Reports (40, 77)]. Additionally, there are mentions of **hereditary diseases** and **epithelial cell disorders** modeled via organoids, including respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases, although specific diseases are not always explicitly named [Data: Reports (79, 80, 76, 77, 79, 80)].

There are broader references to **other genetic disorders** involving nonsense and splice mutations, with discussions on NMD inhibition, readthrough drugs, and mutation correction strategies, which may apply to various genetic diseases beyond CF and cancer [Data: Reports (113, 72)].

### Therapies Discussed in the Corpus

The corpus discusses a wide array of therapeutic approaches, emphasizing both current treatments and innovative gene editing strategies:

- **CFTR Modulators**: These include drugs like ivacaftor, lumacaftor, tezacaftor, elexacaftor, and combination therapies such as Trikafta™, which target specific mutation classes to restore CFTR function [Data: Reports (37, 58, 70, 122)]. These modulators are central to current clinical management of CF.

- **Gene Editing Technologies**: Extensive discussion exists on gene editing approaches such as **prime editing**, **base editing**, and **CRISPR/Cas9**. These techniques are explored for their potential to correct CFTR mutations at the DNA or mRNA level, especially in patient-derived cells, organoids, and primary airway epithelial cells [Data: Reports (6, 8, 108, 85, 77, 14, 56, 120, 23, 45, 55, 93, 94, 67, 84, 100, 80, 92, 109, +more)].

- **Gene Therapy**: Approaches include gene addition and gene correction strategies, with delivery methods such as viral vectors and lipid nanoparticles. These are particularly aimed at mutation-specific correction in airway cells and tissues [Data: Reports (120, 55, 23, 67, 88, 103, 81, 105, +more)].

- **Other Molecular Therapies**: These include **readthrough drugs** for premature termination codon (PTC) mutations, **NMD suppression**, **exon skipping**, **antisense oligonucleotides**, and **mRNA repair** techniques. Such strategies aim to restore CFTR function in cases of nonsense mutations or splicing defects [Data: Reports (35, 62, 118, 27, 27, 27)].

- **Proteostasis and Correctors**: Small molecules like correctors and potentiators (e.g., VX-809, VX-770, VX-445) are discussed for their roles in improving CFTR folding, stability, and function, with some therapies like Trikafta™ being highlighted for their mutation-specific efficacy [Data: Reports (124, 52)].

- **Development of Cellular and Organoid Models**: These models are crucial for functional testing of therapies, supporting personalized medicine by evaluating drug responses and gene correction efficacy in patient-derived tissues [Data: Reports (6, 8, 108, 85, 77, 84, 100, 80, 92, 109, +more)].

### Summary and Implications

The corpus underscores a comprehensive approach to understanding and treating cystic fibrosis, combining existing pharmacological therapies with cutting-edge gene editing technologies. While CF remains the primary disease discussed, the research also supports broader applications in genetic disorders and cancer, emphasizing the versatility of gene editing tools like prime editing and base editing. These strategies hold promise for mutation-specific therapies, potentially leading to personalized treatments that could significantly improve patient outcomes.

In conclusion, the corpus provides a detailed overview of the current landscape and future directions in the treatment of CF and related genetic diseases, highlighting the importance of molecular precision and innovative delivery methods in developing curative therapies [Data: Reports (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 14, 23, 25, 27, 28, 30, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 47, 50, 55, 57, 58, 62, 69, 70, 72, 73, 77, 80, 83, 84, 86, 88, 89, 92, 93, 94, 95, 100, 103, 108, 109, 113, 114, 118, 120, 121, 124, 138, 159, 160, 169, 170, 175, 177, 281, 282, 307, 308, 312, 377, 378, 379, 380, 381, 382, 383, 384, 385, 386, 387, 388, 389, 390, 391, 392, 393, 394, 395, 396, 397, 398, 399, 400, 401, 402, 403, 404, 405, 406, 407, 408, 409, 410, 411, 412, 413, 414, 415, 416, 417, 418, 419, 420, 421, 422, 423, 424, 425, 426, 427, 428, 429, 430, 431, 432, 433, 434, 435, 436, 437, 438, 439, 440, 441, 442, 443, 444, 445, 446, 447, 448, 449, 450, 451, 452, 453, 454, 455, 456, 457, 458, 459, 460, 461, 462, 463, 464, 465, 466, 467, 468, 469, 470, 471, 472, 473, 474, 475, 476, 477, 478, 479, 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488, 489, 490, 491, 492, 493, 494, 495, 496, 497, 498, 499, 500, +more)]
