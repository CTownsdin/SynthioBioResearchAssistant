Correction of nonsense <italic toggle="yes">CFTR</italic> mutations via genomic editing represents a promising therapeutic approach. In this study, we tested whether prime editing, a novel CRISPR-based genomic editing method, can be a potential therapeutic modality to correct nonsense <italic toggle="yes">CFTR</italic> mutations. We generated iPSCs from a CF patient homozygous for the <italic toggle="yes">CFTR</italic> W1282X mutation. We demonstrated that prime editing corrected one mutant allele in iPSCs, which effectively restored CFTR function in iPSC-derived airway epithelial cells and organoids.

Despite all the progress, treatments for nonsense <italic toggle="yes">CFTR</italic> mutations are currently unavailable.</p><p>Correction of nonsense <italic toggle="yes">CFTR</italic> mutations via genomic editing represents a promising approach toward disease amelioration and improved quality of life for patients. Conventional genomic editing methods, such as CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR), rely on the generation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at target genes, which often introduce unwanted <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> mutations (insertions/deletions (INDELs)) and chromosomal rearrangements [<xref rid="pone.0295009.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0295009.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Furthermore, HDR requires the use of a DNA correction template in addition to the guide RNA (gRNA) and Cas9 enzyme, which makes the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> delivery of the HDR repair machinery significantly more challenging. These difficulties could potentially be circumvented by prime editing, a novel CRISPR-based genomic editing approach [<xref rid="pone.0295009.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Prime editing is mediated by a prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) and a prime editor, which is a fusion protein consisting of a Cas9 nickase (nCas9) and a reverse transcriptase (RT) [<xref rid="pone.0295009.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To achieve gene correction via prime editing, the pegRNA first trafficks the prime editor near the target site to nick one strand of the genomic DNA, the RT then reverse transcribes an RNA template (with corrected genetic information) embedded in the pegRNA to make a short corrected DNA strand, and this short DNA strand is incorporated into genomic DNA by cellular DNA repair machinery to achieve the correction [<xref rid="pone.0295009.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Thus, prime editing-mediated gene correction does not require the delivery of a separate DNA repair template. Because of not introducing DSBs, prime editing also minimizes the risk of introducing INDELs. Prime editing has been shown to generate perfect nucleotide replacement up to 80 base pairs [<xref rid="pone.0295009.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The inefficient delivery of gene correction machinery often represents a major challenge for gene therapy.

Helper-dependent adenovirus (HDAd) is a promising delivery vehicle in gene therapy with a packaging capacity of up to 37 kb [<xref rid="pone.0295009.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], which is sufficient to deliver the entire prime editing machinery.

Based on these data, the nick gRNA(-37)-1 was used for the rest of the study.</p><p>The lengths of the primer binding sequence (PBS) and the template of reverse transcription on pegRNAs have also been suggested to impact the efficiency of prime editing in a locus-dependent manner [<xref rid="pone.0295009.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We then tested editing efficiencies on the W1282 codon by pegRNAs with different PBS and RT template lengths (S1D, S1E Fig in <xref rid="pone.0295009.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref>). We found that pegRNAs with an 11-nucleotide (nt) PBS and a 15-nt RT template were more efficient in editing the W1282 codon (S1F Fig in <xref rid="pone.0295009.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref>). Based on these data, we chose the P11T15 pegRNA, which contains an 11-nt PBS and a 15-nt RT template, to correct the W1282X mutation (<xref rid="pone.0295009.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>).</p><p>To test whether prime editing can correct the W1282X mutation and restore CFTR function, we generated iPSCs from a patient homozygous for the <italic toggle="yes">CFTR</italic> W1282X mutation (<xref rid="pone.0295009.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>).

Delivery of plasmids that express prime editing machinery to airway epithelial cells by nucleofection and related transfection methods had proven ineffective. To efficiently deliver the prime editing machinery and better mimic a therapeutic setting, we constructed an all-in-one helper-dependent adenovirus (HDAd) that expresses all the necessary components of prime editing, which includes the prime editor, the W1282X-pegRNA, the nick gRNA(-37)-1, and a GFP reporter (<xref rid="pone.0295009.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>).

Because modeling lung disease requires the use of healthy and diseased human lung epithelial cells, the shortage of human lung tissue hinders CF research and drug discovery. CF patient-derived iPSCs, which carry the disease-causing <italic toggle="yes">CFTR</italic> mutations, have been used to model the disease, discover drug candidates, and test gene therapy strategies. Several laboratories have developed protocols to differentiate iPSCs into lung tissues [<xref rid="pone.0295009.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295009.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295009.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0295009.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The iPSC-derived airway epithelium and lung organoids form tight junctions, express CFTR, and can be used to assay CFTR channel functions by electrophysiological (e.g., whole-cell patch clamp and Ussing chamber assays) and FIS assays [<xref rid="pone.0295009.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295009.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295009.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295009.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. CF patient-derived iPSCs and the derived airway epithelial cells have also been used to test the various genomic editing approaches, including CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR [<xref rid="pone.0295009.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295009.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we demonstrated that prime editing may restore the function of the <italic toggle="yes">CFTR</italic> W1282X mutant. Compared to the conventional CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR, prime editing does not generate DSBs, which minimizes the likelihood of introducing INDELs and chromosomal rearrangements. Because prime editing does not rely on homologous recombination, it can edit cells with low proliferative potentials, such as airway epithelial cells (<xref rid="pone.0295009.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). In addition, unlike CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR, prime editing does not require a separate repair DNA template. The template module of pegRNA contains the necessary genetic information for gene correction, which is reverse transcribed and incorporated into the genome. Without inducing DSBs and introducing exogenous repair DNA templates, prime editing is likely less toxic to cells.</p><p>In this study, we were able to design a pegRNA to correct the <italic toggle="yes">CFTR</italic> W1282X mutation but not the G542X mutation using the currently available prime editor PE2. Because PE2 is derived from the conventional Cas9 protein, which strictly requires the NGG PAM sequence for target recognition [<xref rid="pone.0295009.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Because Cas9 variants recognizing a broader range of PAM sequences, such as xCas9 or Cas9-NG, had been derived [<xref rid="pone.0295009.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295009.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], more versatile prime editors that would edit a much larger scope of genomic targets may be developed in future studies to edit genomic targets such as the <italic toggle="yes">CFTR</italic> G542X mutation.</p><p>While our data demonstrated prime editing can correct the <italic toggle="yes">CFTR</italic> W1282X mutation in iPSCs and airway epithelial cells, the correction efficiency remains low. The overall correction efficiency is affected by the delivery efficiency of the editing machinery to cells and the editing efficiency of the DNA target. To achieve high delivery efficiency into airway epithelial cells, we used HDAd. Adenovirus is a commonly used delivery vehicle in gene therapy because of its well-characterized biology, broad tropism, and large cloning capacity. Compared to conventional adenovirus, HDAd is less toxic to cells because of the removal of all viral coding sequences [<xref rid="pone.0295009.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295009.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our data showed that while the great majority of the airway epithelial cells (~ 70%) had received the prime editing machinery (S3 Fig in <xref rid="pone.0295009.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref>), only a fraction (~ 2.5%) of DNA targets were corrected (<xref rid="pone.0295009.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). If considering most cells contained a heterozygous repair, the total repaired airway epithelial cells would likely be between 2.5&#8211;5%. The editing efficiency of prime editing is locus-dependent. The editing efficiency could be up to 80% at some genetic loci but low at others [<xref rid="pone.0295009.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Therefore, a better understanding of the variables affecting the editing efficiency, which would lead to further optimization of the prime editing machinery, will be essential to apply prime editing in correcting mutations such as <italic toggle="yes">CFTR</italic> W1282X.</p><p>The restoration of 10 to 35% of CFTR activity has been estimated as a necessary threshold to alleviate pulmonary morbidity [<xref rid="pone.0295009.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Consequently, achieving a correction level spanning from 10 to 35% of mutant <italic toggle="yes">CFTR</italic> alleles is likely imperative for effective CF treatments. However, if the corrected cells primarily comprise basal cells, which can repopulate the airway with functional CFTR-carrying epithelial cells lower editing efficiency may still yield therapeutic benefits. HDAd has proven effective in transducing airway basal cells in animal models [<xref rid="pone.0295009.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, gaining a deeper understanding of the specific cell types corrected by prime editing would yield valuable insights into the prospective applications of gene therapy for CF treatment.</p><p>Recently, base editing, a novel CRISPR-based genomic editing method that enables an A to G or a C to T transition without introducing DSBs and INDELs [<xref rid="pone.0295009.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295009.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], had been successfully applied to repair three <italic toggle="yes">CFTR</italic> mutations including the W1282X mutation [<xref rid="pone.0295009.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The editing efficiency of the W1282X codon can achieve 69% in cultured cells, which makes base editing among the most promising gene therapy methods. However, base editing generates off-target base substitutions in the DNA genome and particularly on RNA molecules, primarily because base editors can modify any DNA or RNA substrates in proximity [<xref rid="pone.0295009.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0295009.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The A residue immediately downstream of the <italic toggle="yes">CFTR</italic> W1282X codon had been converted to a G residue in 16% of the genome, which led to a <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> arginine to glycine (<underline>A</underline>GG &#8594; <underline>G</underline>GG) substitution [<xref rid="pone.0295009.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Compared to base editing, prime editing shows little off-target effects because prime editors only function after sequence complementations between the DNA target and both gRNA and PBS (<xref rid="pone.0295009.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). However, likely contributed by the additional demand for sequence complementation, prime editing is generally less efficient, and relatively fewer genomic loci are amenable to its modification. Very recently, the <italic toggle="yes">CFTR</italic> F508del mutation had been repaired by prime editing in human intestinal organoids but also at low efficiency [<xref rid="pone.0295009.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Several recent studies suggested that the efficiency of prime editing may be significantly improved. Nelson et al. reported pegRNAs may be stabilized by adding a structured RNA motif to the 3&#8217; ends, which led to a 3 to 4-fold increase in the editing efficiencies of tested loci [<xref rid="pone.0295009.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Chen et al. reported a 3 to 7-fold increase in prime editing efficiency may be achieved by manipulating the cellular DNA mismatch repair pathway [<xref rid="pone.0295009.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Anzalone et al. reported a twin prime editing approach, which involves a pair of pegRNAs simultaneously editing two adjacent sites surrounding the targeting locus, could not only enable deletion, replacement, and insertion of larger DNA fragments but also enhance editing efficiency [<xref rid="pone.0295009.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Together with our results, prime editing may be a strategy to correct <italic toggle="yes">CFTR</italic> mutations, however, further optimization to improve editing efficiency is required.</p></sec><sec id="sec020" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0295009.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>It includes four supporting figures, figure legends, and a supporting table.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0295009.s001.docx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0295009.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S2 Appendix</label><caption><title>W1282X organoid FIS assay.</title><p>(WMV)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0295009.s002.wmv" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-ms-wmv" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0295009.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S3 Appendix</label><caption><title>PE organoid FIS assay.</title><p>(WMV)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0295009.s003.wmv" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-ms-wmv" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Philip Ng for kindly providing adenoviral plasmid, helper virus, and the packing cell line.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0295009.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name name-style="western"><surname>Rowe</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Sorscher</surname><given-names>EJ</given-names></name>. <article-title>Cystic fibrosis.</article-title><source>N Engl J Med</source>. <year>2005</year>;<volume>352</volume>(<issue>19</issue>):<fpage>1992</fpage>&#8211;<lpage>2001</lpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1056/NEJMra043184</pub-id> .<pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15888700</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0295009.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name name-style="western"><surname>Ratjen</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Bell</surname><given-names>SC</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Rowe</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Goss</surname><given-names>CH</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Quittner</surname><given-names>AL</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Bush</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>. <article-title>Cystic fibrosis.</article-title><source>Nat Rev Dis Primers</source>. <year>2015</year>;<volume>1</volume>:<fpage>15010</fpage>.

The results presented in the main figures of the manuscript provide a concise and impactful study on the use of prime editing to &#8220;fix&#8221; CFTR mutation p.W1282X. The major advances presented here are the use of an &#8220;all-in-one&#8221; helper dependent Adenovirus (HDAd) to efficiently deliver all of the prime editing machinery to iPSC-derived airway epithelial cells and restore p.W1282X-CFTR function. Because of the size of the payload, this has previously not been able to be achieved. This reviewer found much of the interesting biology to be in the supplemental figures, where a good amount of optimization was performed. There are only a few comments to address.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>1) The authors touted the ability of delivering all of the machinery in a helper dependent adenovirus (HDAd) system for efficient editing. However, even with a plasmid system containing all of the PE machinery and high transfection efficiency, the editing efficiency was only 0.36% in iPSCs. (Fig 1D). With the HDAd system providing ~70% transduction efficiency of differentiated airway epithelial cells only corrected 2-3% of the p.W1282X alleles. Indeed, the bottleneck for correction of p.W1282X CF mutations is the overall efficiency of prime editing, not delivery. While there is nice discussion on this issue, the technical limitations of prime editing will take time to resolve. Maybe this bottleneck would not be a significant issue if in that population of transduced cells, basal cells were effectively edited. This would lead to a repopulation of airway epithelial cells with edited alleles and rescued CFTR function, thereby amplifying the therapeutic impact of low-efficiency prime editing. Important for this study, what cell types in the differentiated airway epithelia were transduced by HDAd? Are basal cells included in this population?</p><p>2) Why was functional rescue of p.W1282X-CFTR prime edited differentiated epithelial cells not reported? It would seem that even with as low as 1.5% editing there would be measurable rescue of CFTR function by Ussing chamber assays for measurement of short circuit current (Isc). Indeed, the CFTR functional rescue is often significantly higher than the genome editing efficiency.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#160;I have reviewed the manuscript numbered PONE-D-23-20582, titled &#8220;Prime editing-mediated correction of the CFTR W1282X mutation in iPSCs and derived airway epithelial cells&#8221;, submitted by Chao L., Zhong L., et al.</p><p>This article, presenting an original research, is very interesting and very clearly described.</p><p>In the manuscript, the authors have developed a novel PRIME editing system for the correction of the W1282X CFTR mutation.</p><p>The authors did a very good initial screening job for the components of the PRIME editing System (as reported also in supplementary information) and then, validated the best one in iPSCs generated from nasal epithelial cells of a homozygous W1282X cystic fibrosis patient.</p><p>PE-iPSCs were also differentiated into airway epithelial cells and lung organoids, for testing the restored CFTR function. As a very important point to become a therapeutic modality, the Authors tested the PRIME editing system directly in differentiated airway epithelial cells, using an HDAd vector containing all the sequences needed for the prime editing system (all-in &#8211;one vector).</p><p>In conclusion, the Authors demonstrated the correction of the point mutation albeit in a limited number (2.5-5%) of iPS-derived epithelial cells and, very importantly, getting no indels effect though the DNA.</p><p>These results could be very useful for the development of an in-vivo PRIME editing system for stop mutation in CF.</p><p>The only suggestion to the Authors could be to add a sentence in the discussion, in particular in the paragraph stating the editing efficiency, indicating (if it is known) what could hypothetically be the correction rate to be reached by PRIME-CRISPR/Cas9-based systems, in order to get a therapeutic level of CFTR for CF patients.</p><p>Other specific comments:</p><p>-Are Results and Conclusions presented in an appropriate fashion and are supported by the data?</p><p>YES. Results are very well written, linear, and complete. The same is for the Conclusions (see my only suggestion above).</p><p>-Is the article presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p><p>YES</p><p>- Does the research meet all applicable standards for the ethics of experimentation and research integrity?</p><p>YES</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

The major advances presented here are the use of an &#8220;all-in-one&#8221; helper dependent Adenovirus (HDAd) to efficiently deliver all of the prime editing machinery to iPSC-derived airway epithelial cells and restore p.W1282X-CFTR function. Because of the size of the payload, this has previously not been able to be achieved. This reviewer found much of the interesting biology to be in the supplemental figures, where a good amount of optimization was performed. There are only a few comments to address.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>1) The authors touted the ability of delivering all of the machinery in a helper dependent adenovirus (HDAd) system for efficient editing. However, even with a plasmid system containing all of the PE machinery and high transfection efficiency, the editing efficiency was only 0.36% in iPSCs. (Fig 1D). With the HDAd system providing ~70% transduction efficiency of differentiated airway epithelial cells only corrected 2-3% of the p.W1282X alleles. Indeed, the bottleneck for correction of p.W1282X CF mutations is the overall efficiency of prime editing, not delivery. While there is nice discussion on this issue, the technical limitations of prime editing will take time to resolve. Maybe this bottleneck would not be a significant issue if in that population of transduced cells, basal cells were effectively edited. This would lead to a repopulation of airway epithelial cells with edited alleles and rescued CFTR function, thereby amplifying the therapeutic impact of low-efficiency prime editing. Important for this study, what cell types in the differentiated airway epithelia were transduced by HDAd? Are basal cells included in this population?</p><p>&#65533; We agree that the observed low correction efficiency could hold therapeutic significance if the corrected cells are predominantly basal cells. For iPSC differentiation into airway epithelium, we primarily followed the published protocol (ref. 29 and 30), which demonstrated the presence of basal cells in iPSC-derived epithelium. HDAd can effectively transduce airway basal cells in animal models (ref. 22). However, determining prime editing-corrected cell types is technically challenging. Our current experimental system detects the prime editing-mediated single nucleotide substitution solely by ddPCR. The ddPCR procedure prevents simultaneous cell type identification. </p><p>A potential solution to this important question is to construct a W1282X reporter iPSC line, in which a GFP reporter will be fused in-frame to the 3&#8217; end of the mutant CFTR W1282X open reading frame. Because of the W1282X mutation, uncorrected airway cells would remain GFP negative but airway cells with correction would become GFP positive. The GFP-positive cells can then be FACS-sorted for marker staining and single-cell sequencing analysis. However, this approach involves a significant amount of efforts and we believe it should become a follow-up study of the current report. We agree this is an important point that should be further explored. We have included a discussion on the potential implications of correcting basal cells in the revised manuscript (Page 15).</p><p>2) Why was functional rescue of p.W1282X-CFTR prime edited differentiated epithelial cells not reported? It would seem that even with as low as 1.5% editing there would be measurable rescue of CFTR function by Ussing chamber assays for measurement of short circuit current (Isc). Indeed, the CFTR functional rescue is often significantly higher than the genome editing efficiency.</p><p>&#65533; We agree with the reviewer and have conducted the recommended experiment (supplemental Figure S4). In the prime-edited airway epithelium, we detected a minor Isc spike following FSK stimulation, a response absent in the unedited controls. When compared to the PE-iPSC-derived airway epithelium (Fig. 3B), the amplitude of the FSK-induced Isc is approximately 20-fold lower, which is in line with the expected functional CFTR allele frequencies (~2.5% vs. 50%). However, we did not observe a VX-770-induced Isc change, which could be attributed to the generally low Isc signals of the HDAd-corrected epithelium or other unidentified factors. We have included these new data in the revised manuscript (Fig. S4 and page 13). </p><p>Reviewer #2: I have reviewed the manuscript numbered PONE-D-23-20582, titled &#8220;Prime editing-mediated correction of the CFTR W1282X mutation in iPSCs and derived airway epithelial cells&#8221;, submitted by Chao L., Zhong L., et al.</p><p>This article, presenting an original research, is very interesting and very clearly described.</p><p>In the manuscript, the authors have developed a novel PRIME editing system for the correction of the W1282X CFTR mutation. The authors did a very good initial screening job for the components of the PRIME editing System (as reported also in supplementary information) and then, validated the best one in iPSCs generated from nasal epithelial cells of a homozygous W1282X cystic fibrosis patient. PE-iPSCs were also differentiated into airway epithelial cells and lung organoids, for testing the restored CFTR function. As a very important point to become a therapeutic modality, the Authors tested the PRIME editing system directly in differentiated airway epithelial cells, using an HDAd vector containing all the sequences needed for the prime editing system (all-in &#8211;one vector).</p><p>In conclusion, the Authors demonstrated the correction of the point mutation albeit in a limited number (2.5-5%) of iPS-derived epithelial cells and, very importantly, getting no indels effect though the DNA.</p><p>These results could be very useful for the development of an in-vivo PRIME editing system for stop mutation in CF.</p><p>The only suggestion to the Authors could be to add a sentence in the discussion, in particular in the paragraph stating the editing efficiency, indicating (if it is known) what could hypothetically be the correction rate to be reached by PRIME-CRISPR/Cas9-based systems, in order to get a therapeutic level of CFTR for CF patients.</p><p>&#65533; We agree that this is an important point. It is believed that restoration of 10 to 35% of CFTR activities would be required to mitigate pulmonary morbidity (PMID: 15510065). Based on this estimation, a correction level ranging from 10 to 35% mutant alleles would be necessary. However, if the corrected cells primarily comprise basal cells, therapeutic advantages could potentially be attained with lower editing efficiency. We have included this discussion in the revised manuscript (page 15).</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0295009.s004" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Rebuttal_03.pdf</named-content></p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0295009.s004.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0295009.r003" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0295009.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Branchini</surname><given-names initials="A">Alessio</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#169; 2023 Alessio Branchini</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2023</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Alessio Branchini</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" related-article-type="reviewed-article" id="rel-obj003" xml:lang="en" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0295009"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
